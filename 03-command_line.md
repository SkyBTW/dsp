* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)
